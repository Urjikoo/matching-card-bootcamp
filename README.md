# ♠️ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Matching Card Game

I made a 10 card memory game where users must be able to select two cards and check if they are a match. If they are a match, they stay flipped. If not, they flip back over. Game is done when all cards are matched and flipped over. 
I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
